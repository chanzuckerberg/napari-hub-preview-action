# napari hub preview action

This GitHub action generates a napari hub plugin preview page and produces the static page as
an artifact.

To view your plugin as it would appear on the napari hub, first install the [napari hub Plugin Preview App](https://github.com/apps/napari-hub-plugin-preview)
to your plugin repository, and then use this action in a workflow file, as in [this example](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/blob/main/docs/setting-up-preview.md#2-set-up-the-github-workflow).

For more detailed instructions on installing the app, adding the action to a workflow or using the preview page, you
can refer to [this guide](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/blob/main/docs/setting-up-preview.md).

If you notice any problems using this action, please let us know by raising an issue on [this repo](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub-preview-action/issues/new).
